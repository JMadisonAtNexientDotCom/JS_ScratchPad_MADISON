The gauntlet ui will fail to launch because the apps are dependent
on express.js running on a node.js server.


WHAT IT DOES:
1: Makes service calls.
   The basic idea is to have an api_caller "class" that we will
   be able to use to make service calls.
2: Handles adapting/routing to mock,static, or live apis
   Depending on the config. To allow for easy deployment.

WHY WE NEED IT:
When in testing mode, the api_caller is configured to use
the mock_api. When in release mode, the api_caller is configured
to use the ACTUAL live api of the nexient testing service.

This will enable smooth switch from dev to release.
Because none of the code within our HTML pages or angular apps
will have to change.
