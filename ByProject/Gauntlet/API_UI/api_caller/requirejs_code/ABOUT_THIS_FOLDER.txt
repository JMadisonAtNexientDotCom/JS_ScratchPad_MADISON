app_library:
Holds applications that are build using classes from the class_library.

class_library:
Where you store all of the javascript "classes" that we will use together
in larger solutions. Usually those larger solutions will be in the app_library,
but require.js allows you to import "classes" individually into your
html script blocks. So you can make use of class_library code without
having to make an app in the app_library.

"classes": I say "classes" because there is really no such thin as classes in
           javascript. However, I am using require.js to get class functionality
					 into the code base.

linkers:
       In require.js terms, this would be the .config folder.
       I am calling it "linkers" because the
       XXXXX_linker.js file you use depends on where the .html
       file you are using lives.

       All of our linkers import the SAME app_library and
       class_library. The different linkers files only exist
       so that paths are correctly resolved.
